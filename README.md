# Hello there! 👋
## I'm Manuel, a creative web developer living in Pisa, Italy 🇮🇹

I mainly work in e-commerce (Jewelry and high-end watches ATM), where my other skills in digital graphics, marketing and data analysis can combine to provide great results. Through my work experience I also help smaller companies to take their first steps in the digital world.
